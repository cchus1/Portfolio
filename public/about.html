<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>On a journey to change career paths.</p>

<p>I spent most of my profesional life in the hospitality industry with a focus on bar operations. After some injuries and some thoughts on my future life style, I decided to start learning programing to, at some point, get a more flexible work option. </p>

<p>This is a work on progress page that I'll update and improve as I grow into this new path.</p>
